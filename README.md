üìã Notes
-----
- Only domain name values are accepted in the `domains` field.
- We do not support wildcard input like `*.tld` or `*.tld.*`.
- **domains** field includes TLD names associated with the target program, not based on scope of the program.
- Subdomains are populated using **Passive API** (chaos dataset).
